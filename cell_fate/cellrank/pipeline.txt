To run Cellrank using a multivelo results object, run these scripts in this order:

1.	Compute_vk.py 
2a.	set_macrostates.py #if using previous knowledge to set macrostates, in this case, latent time (see how this was done in run_multivelo_pt2.py)
2b.	infer_fate.py #if want to use Cellrank to predict macrostates
3.	get_fate_probabilities.py
		(Optional) run transfer_fate_probabilities.py to transfer the calculated fate probabilites from the obsm to obs, then save the metadata as a csv
4.	uncover_driver_genes.py
